# storm
A full repositry for effects that you can use to make some things rain in your website
## How do i use effects?
For visual effects like [SnowRain.js](https://github.com/NeotiDev/storm/blob/master/snowrain.js). You need to use our CDN,

Just like this.
Paste this code in between <head> and </head> tag of your website:

```<!-- Effects by NeotiDev : https://github.com/NeotiDev -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://storm.neotidev.cf/<filename>"></script>
<!-- Effects by NeotiDev : https://github.com/NeotiDev -->
```
For snowrain.js, you can use this.


```<!-- Effects by NeotiDev : https://github.com/NeotiDev -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://storm.neotidev.cf/snowrain.js"></script>
<!-- Effects by NeotiDev : https://github.com/NeotiDev -->
```
